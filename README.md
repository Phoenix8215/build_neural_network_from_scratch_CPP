# Let's build a neural network from scratch together.üòù

## Project Overview
Created a simple neural network using C++17 standard and the Eigen library that supports both forward and backward propagation.

By using only the sigmoid function as the activation function, the backpropagation process is very simple, making it a perfect case for beginners in deep learning.

## Instructions
